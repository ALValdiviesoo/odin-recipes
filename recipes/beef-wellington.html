  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Beef fillet</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Olive oil</li>
    <li>Prosciutto or Parma ham</li>
    <li>Pâté</li>
    <li>Puff pastry</li>
    <li>Egg wash</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Prepare the Beef: Start by trimming the fat and silver skin from a beef tenderloin and season it with salt and pepper. Sear the beef in a hot pan until browned on all sides, then set aside to cool.
    </li>

    <li>
      Prepare the Duxelles: Finely chop mushrooms, shallots, garlic, and thyme in a food processor to make a duxelles. Cook the duxelles in a pan with butter until the liquid has evaporated and it forms a paste. Season with salt and pepper.
    </li>

    <li>
      Assemble the Wellington: Roll out a sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface and spread the duxelles over it, leaving a border around the edges. Place the seared beef in the center and wrap the pastry around it, sealing the edges.
    </li>

    <li>
      Chill the Wellington: Place the Wellington in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to allow the pastry to firm up.
    </li>

    <li>
      Brush with Egg Wash: Beat an egg and brush it over the top of the Wellington to give it a golden brown finish.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bake: Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and bake the Wellington for about 35-40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the beef is cooked to your liking. Let the Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
